    November 20, 2014-­‐-­‐Mitchell Contractors Inc., a 32-­‐year old general contracting
    firm, has completed a massive, yearlong rehabilitation project at the Four Freedoms House
    of Seattle and the Henry M. Jackson Apartments operated by Prudent Properties of Miami, FL.
    </p>
    <p>Built in  1963, the Four  Freedoms  House complex has been  home  to  low-income  seniors for
    more  than  50  years.    The newer Henry M.  Jackson building, constructed in  1982, completes
    the senior  housing facility  of  372 total units,  situated  on  a 6-acre  site  on scenic Bitter  Lake.
    This  property, even  though  well  maintained, is  typical of  older, senior developments  and
    was overdue for structural  and cosmetic  upgrades.
